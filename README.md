# Computational Oral History
NLP pipeline for computational analysis of historical narratives using Named Entity Recognition and Topic Modeling to extract thematic patterns and key historical data from 250+ pages of oral history transcripts.

## 🐍 Python Stack

- **Python 3.9+**
- **spaCy** +
- **gensim**
- **NLTK** 
- **pandas** +
- **matplotlib/seaborn** 
- **pyLDAvis**

## 💡 Motivation

As a researcher fascinated by how narratives shape historical understanding and oral history volunteer, I wanted to explore whether NLP could help historians work more efficiently with oral testimonies, specifically in indexing and annotating corpora. This project bridges digital humanities and data science, showing how spaCy and topic modeling can reveal patterns across hundreds of pages that might take weeks to identify manually.
